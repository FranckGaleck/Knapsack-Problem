# 🎒 The Knapsack Problem – Advanced Algorithms Project (Université Jean Monnet)

This repository contains the final project for the *Advanced Algorithms* course (MLDM 2022–2024), Université Jean Monnet.  
It implements and evaluates multiple strategies to solve the classical **0/1 Knapsack Problem** and its multi-knapsack variant.

## 📦 Project Description

The main goal was to **implement**, **benchmark**, and **compare** the performance of different well-known algorithmic approaches for solving the knapsack problem in both **low-dimensional** and **multi-knapsack** settings.

| 🧠 Exact            | Brute Force, Meet in the Middle, Backtracking, Branch and Bound            |
| 🧮 Dynamic           | Dynamic Programming                                                        |
| ⚡ Heuristics       | Greedy, Genetic Algorithm, Randomized Search                               |
| 📉 Approximation    | Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS)                         |
| 🧺 Multi-Knapsack   | Adaptations of Brute Force and Greedy for multiple knapsacks               |

Each approach is implemented modularly, with consistent interfaces for testing and benchmarking.

## 📊 Datasets Used

The algorithms were tested on real benchmark instances from:

- 📁 Low-dimensional 0/1 Knapsack problem dataset
- 📁 Multiple knapsack problem dataset

A **custom problem generator** is also included for flexible instance creation.
